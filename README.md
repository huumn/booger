# booger

A nostr relay

### ðŸš¨ breaking changes incoming

i'm changing the code a lot in a backwards incompatible way ... this probably
isn't ready for prod yet until it has defenses either

# what booger does

- supports many NIPs: 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 26, 28, 33, 40
- suitable for horizontally scaling websocket layer with a load balancer

# what booger doesn't do (yet)

- defend itself: no rate limits, spam prevention, payments
  - i'd like to provide these via some plugin mechanism (workers,
    maybe?)
- use postgres read replicas

# booger in words

- deno serves websockets
- filters are stored in a sqlite in memory database and mapped to a websocket
- events are persisted in postgres
- when an event is persisted (or an ephemeral event is received) a postgres
  `NOTIFY event, <event json>` is broadcast
- all booger processes in the cluster `LISTEN event` and when notified check
  sqlite for matching filters and send to corresponding websockets

# how to run (locally)

0. [install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and run it (welcome to app programming)
0. [insall deno](https://deno.land/) (welcome to deno)
1. clone booger
2. configure env in `.env.defaults`
3. deno task dev

# what booger wants

simplicity, ease of use, extensibility, scalability, performance, security

# thanks to

1. [camari's nostream](https://github.com/Cameri/nostream) - heavily inspired booger's validation and integration tests
